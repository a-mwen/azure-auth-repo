### Key Updates:
1. Fixed the repository clone URL to point to the correct repository (`azure-auth-repo`).
2. Added instructions to configure the `.env` file with Azure AD B2C details (`REACT_APP_TENANT_NAME`, `REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID`, etc.).
3. Fixed a small typo and improved clarity for each section.

This README should now be good to go! You can paste this directly into your `README.md` file in the root of your repository.

Let me know if you'd like me to adjust anything further!
